  - name: About Me
    text: |
      Over this last school year, I have been working in various capacities as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant at Oranim College in Israel. My primary responsibilities include helping in academic writing, rhetoric, and linguistics courses and meeting with students to help with their seminar papers. I also lead an English-in-the-workplace conversation course for international students.

      My previous graduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin placed heavy emphasis on a knowledge of second language acquisition. In many of my courses, I learned about contemporary language teaching methodologies while working as a teaching assistant for some intensive Hebrew classes.

      In addition to my own academic writing and publishing, I also spent much time during my undergraduate studies strenghtening my writing and editing abilities while working as a research assistant. These experiences culminated in my selection to serve as editor-in-chief of a student journal, *Studia Antiqua*, throughout my last year at Brigham Young University.

I would love to interview with you to discuss my potential contribution to the English Language Institute. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
