  - name: About Me
    text: |
      Over the past several years, I have been teaching in various positions while completing an M.A. in Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures from the University of Texas at Austin. My studies placed heavy emphasis on second language acquisition courses, in which I learned about contemporary language teaching methodologies. I focused my personal research on the use of instructional technologies and the creation of educational materials for Modern Hebrew.
      \vspace{8pt}\
      Some of my teaching highlights include:
      \vspace{4pt}\
      • Teaching Intensive Modern Hebrew to university students as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for four semesters.\
      • Teaching English as a Fulbright Fellow in Israel to Israeli college students and international Masa students.\
      • Training Masa Israel English Teaching Fellows on foreign language teaching methodologies.\
      • Using web technologies to teach English online to dozens of children in China.\
      • Co-teaching an introductory Biblical Hebrew course at Brigham Young University.
